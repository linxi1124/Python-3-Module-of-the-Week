    "Up to this point the examples have all avoided mingling concurrency and I/O operations to focus on one concept at a time. However, switching contexts when I/O blocks is one of the primary use cases for asyncio. Building on the concurrency concepts already introduced, this section examines two sample programs implementing a simple echo server and client, similar to the examples used in the socket and socketserver sections. A client can connect to the server, send some data, and then receive the same data as a response. Each time an I/O operation is initiated, the executing code gives up control to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run until the I/O is ready.\n",
