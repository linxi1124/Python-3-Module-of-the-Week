"""
Using map() with a Basic Thread PoolÂ¶
The ThreadPoolExecutor manages a set of worker threads, 
passing tasks to them as they become available for more work. 
This example uses map() to concurrently produce a set of results 
from an input iterable. The task uses time.sleep() to pause a different amount of time to demonstrate that, regardless of the order of execution of concurrent tasks, map() always returns the values in order based on the inputs.
