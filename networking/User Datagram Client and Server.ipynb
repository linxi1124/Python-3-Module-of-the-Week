    "The user datagram protocol (UDP) works differently from TCP/IP. Where TCP is a stream oriented protocol, ensuring that all of the data is transmitted in the right order, UDP is a message oriented protocol. UDP does not require a long-lived connection, so setting up a UDP socket is a little simpler. On the other hand, UDP messages must fit within a single datagram (for IPv4, that means they can only hold 65,507 bytes because the 65,535 byte packet also includes header information) and delivery is not guaranteed as it is with TCP.\n",
